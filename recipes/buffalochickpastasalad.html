    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a saucepan over a medium heat and add the peri-peri sauce and garlic powder. Cook for 2 minutes, then add butter and salt and cook for a further 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Chop celery, tomatoes and pepper into bite-size pieces, and then shred the chicken using two forks. Place into a large mixing bowl with the cooked pasta.</li>
        <li>Pour over buffalo sauce and toss it through the pasta salad. Divide amongst 3 meal-prep containers and drizzle a little ranch dressing over each, and serve with a handful of mixed leaves or your favourite side salad. Refrigerate for up to 3 days and enjoy hot or cold.</li>
